# CLAUDE.md — rail0-ts

Working instructions for Claude Code. These rules apply to the entire rail0 project and are duplicated in every repo.

## Project structure

rail0 is a multi-repo project. All repositories prefixed with `rail0-` are part of the same project, as is `rail0` itself (the smart contract). All repos are located under the same parent directory.

| Repo | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `rail0` | EVM smart contract (Solidity) |
| `rail0-gateway` | Backend API (Ruby/Grape) |
| `rail0-indexer` | On-chain event indexer (TypeScript/Envio) |
| `rail0-admin` | Admin UI |
| `rail0-cli` | CLI tool |
| `rail0-ruby` | Ruby SDK |
| `rail0-go` | Go SDK |
| `rail0-ts` | TypeScript SDK |
| `rail0-test` | Integration and cross-SDK tests |

> Note: `rail0-api`, `rail0-py`, and `rail0-rust` are temporarily out of scope.

When a change in one repo affects the contract, the indexer, or any SDK, flag it explicitly and propose coordinated changes across the relevant repos.

## Rules

1. **Always propose before implementing.** For any non-trivial change, present a plan of action and wait for explicit confirmation before writing any code.

2. **Follow language and framework conventions.** Respect the idioms and conventions of the language and framework used in each repo. Match the style of surrounding code.

3. **Never add new migrations — edit existing ones.** Until further notice, schema changes must be made by modifying the relevant existing migration file, not by creating a new one.

4. **Do not make structural changes without consent.** The architecture of each repo is intentional. Do not reorganise layers, introduce new abstractions, or change project layout without explicit approval.

5. **Avoid duplication — favour reuse and centralisation.** Before adding code, check whether the functionality already exists. Prefer extending existing helpers, concerns, or modules over creating parallel implementations.

6. **Always work on a branch.** Never commit directly to `main`. If no branch exists for the current task, create one before making any changes using the naming convention `feature/short-desc` for new functionality or `fix/short-desc` for bug fixes, where `short-desc` is a concise dashed description of the change (e.g. `feature/rpc-node-pool`, `fix/hmac-replay-window`).

7. **Use Conventional Commits format.** Every commit message must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification: `type(scope): description`, where type is one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`. Example: `feat(payments): add idempotency key support`.

8. **Always open a draft PR.** After the first push to a branch, open a pull request in draft status if one does not already exist. The PR title must also follow Conventional Commits format.

9. **Never log sensitive data.** Do not log private keys, signatures, raw transaction payloads, HMAC secrets, JWT tokens, or any user-identifying data. When logging errors or request context, include only non-sensitive identifiers (e.g. `payment_id`, `chain_id`, `operation`).

10. **Comment non-obvious functions.** Add a detailed comment to any method whose logic is not immediately clear from its name alone — explaining what it does, why it works that way, and any non-obvious invariants or edge cases. Simple CRUD methods need no comment; complex query builders, state machine guards, cryptographic operations, and multi-step workflows do.

11. **Keep documentation and tests in sync.** After every change, update all of the following that are present in the repo: README, OpenAPI schema, database schema reference, Postman collection, and unit tests. Do not consider a task complete until all are consistent with the code.

12. **Keep all SDKs aligned when asked.** When asked to update the SDKs, check every SDK repo (`rail0-ruby`, `rail0-go`, `rail0-ts`, `rail0-py`, `rail0-rust`, `rail0-cli`) for alignment with the current gateway API surface. For each SDK: update client methods, README, and unit tests. Flag any SDK where alignment requires a breaking change.

13. **Align all tests when asked.** When asked to align or update tests, cover both layers: unit tests in every affected repo (gateway, indexer, all SDKs), and integration tests in `rail0-test` (API tests, flow tests for each SDK language, and cross-SDK tests). Verify that test fixtures, helper methods, and expected response shapes are consistent with the current gateway behaviour.

## Repo-specific notes

- **Stack:** TypeScript/Node.js package (SDK).
- **Documentation:** `README.md` — keep in sync with every change.
